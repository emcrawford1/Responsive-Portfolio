                Hi! Thanks for visiting my page! As you can tell from the title, my name is Eric Crawford. I am
                currently a member of the first Vanderbilt Software Coding bootcamp class and am working towards a
                career in software development. To give you some professional background on myself, I graduated with a
                degree in Accounting from Trevecca Nazarene University in 2008 and have been working in the audit field
                for the last 8 years. Additionally, I received my CPA certification several years ago. Although, I want
                to keep my options open, I am seriously thinking of working as a software developer in the financial
                industry. We'll see.
            </p>

            <p>
                On a personal note, I love the middle-Tennessee area and am a die hard Nashville Predators fan. I also
                enjoy traveling and love to snowboard. I grew up in the Deep South, but have always held a fondness for
                the winter.
            </p>

            <p>
                This site is a bit of a work in progress as I get experience with more technologies and add more
                projects to my portfolio, so be sure to come back soon. If you have any questions or would like to set
                up a time to meet, follow the Contact link and send me a message!
            </p>
